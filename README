GShoppingContent
================

PHP library for using Google Content API for Shopping.

Dependencies:
    * CURL http://php.net/curl
    * DOM http://php.net/dom

    (most distributions carry these)

GShoppingContent is a PHP library for communicating with the Google Content API
for Shopping. This API is used to upload your retail products to Google
Shopping.

The library is entirely self contained, depending only on the DOM and Curl
libraries built into most modern PHP distributions. It is presented as a single
php file that can be dropped into any application for convenience.

See http://gshoppingcontent-php.appspot.com/ or docs/html (if you have the
source code) for more details.
